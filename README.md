## Usage

Sydney is designed to respond to natural language queries from users. You can ask Sydney questions, or just have a casual conversation. Here are some example queries that Sydney can respond to:

- "What is the weather like in Sydney today?"
- "Tell me a joke"
- "Can you recommend a good Italian restaurant?"
- "What's the meaning of life?"

If Sydney doesn't understand your query, it will let you know and suggest alternative queries that you might try.

## Customizing Sydney
You can customize Sydney by modifying the respondToMessage function in the index.js file. This function is responsible for generating responses to user queries.

By default, respondToMessage sends the user's message to the ChatGPT endpoint and returns the response generated by the model. You can modify this function to add additional logic, such as filtering out certain types of messages, or preprocessing the user's message before sending it to ChatGPT.
