# There are 2 ways to transcribe audio: using WhisperAI, which costs US$0.06 per 10 minutes of audio, or using WhisperAI locally.
# Local transcription is slower and provides worse results, but it is free.
# If you choose to use the local method, you need to install WhisperAI. Refer to the readme.md file for more information.
TRANSCRIPTION_METHOD="local"  # options are 'local' or 'api'
# TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE improves the transcription results but is not required. If you only plan to send audio in one language,
# it is recommended to specify the language. If you will use multiple languages, leave it blank.
# It's only needed in local mode.
TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE=""  # "--language pt" (pt = Portuguese), list of languages: https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py (OPTIONAL)
